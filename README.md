# üß† Zappy

Welcome to our implementation of **Zappy**, a multiplayer network game built as part of the Epitech YEP (Year-End Project).

This repository contains the complete source code for:
- `zappy_server`: the game server (written in C)
- `zappy_gui`: the graphical client (written in C++ with SFML)
- `zappy_ai`: an autonomous AI client (written in Rust)

Our version strictly follows the official Zappy protocol and architecture, with a strong focus on modularity, clean command handling, multithreaded networking, and a responsive GUI.

## üß© How the Game Works

Zappy is a real-time multiplayer game where teams of AI players compete to evolve to the highest level. The game takes place on a 2D toroidal map filled with various resources.

### Objective

The first team to have **6 players at level 8** wins the game.

### Core Concepts

- **Map**: a flat, wraparound grid of tiles containing players and resources.
- **Resources**:
  - `food`, `linemate`, `deraumere`, `sibur`, `mendiane`, `phiras`, `thystame`
- **Elevation**: players level up by performing **incantations**, which require specific amounts of resources and other players of the same level on the same tile.
- **Teams**: each team starts with a set number of available slots (eggs) and must coordinate its players to evolve.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management

Zappy uses a unit-based time system controlled by the `-f` parameter passed to the server.

- All actions take a duration proportional to `1 / freq`, where `freq` is the time unit multiplier.

### Life

Each player starts with 1260 time units (i.e., `1260 / f` seconds). They must consume `food` to stay alive. Every food unit gives +126 time units.


## üõ∞Ô∏è AI Protocol Overview

The AI client communicates with the server via TCP sockets using plain text commands.

### Initial Handshake

1. Server -> `WELCOME`
2. Client -> `team_name`
3. Server -> `client_number`
4. Server -> `map_size_x map_size_y`

### Core Commands

| Action       | Command           | Duration      | Response       |
|--------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Move forward | `Forward`         | `7 / f`       | `ok`           |
| Turn left    | `Left`            | `7 / f`       | `ok`           |
| Turn right   | `Right`           | `7 / f`       | `ok`           |
| See         | `Look`            | `7 / f`       | `[tile1, ...]` |
| Inventory   | `Inventory`       | `1 / f`       | `[food n, ...]`|
| Take item   | `Take object`     | `7 / f`       | `ok` / `ko`    |
| Drop item   | `Set object`      | `7 / f`       | `ok` / `ko`    |
| Fork (egg)  | `Fork`            | `42 / f`      | `ok`           |
| Broadcast   | `Broadcast text`  | `7 / f`       | `ok`           |
| Start level-up | `Incantation`  | `300 / f`     | `Elevation underway` / `ko` |
| Free slots  | `Connect_nbr`     | `0`           | `<number>`     |

Each command must be followed by a newline (`\n`), and the server responds in order.


## üñºÔ∏è GUI Protocol Overview

The GUI client connects using a reserved team name:
```
GRAPHIC
```

###
 GUI receives real-time updates via these messages:

| Message        | Description                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `msz X Y`      | Map size                                     |
| `bct X Y q0..q6` | Tile content at (X,Y)                     |
| `mct`          | Entire map content (multiple `bct`)          |
| `tna N`        | Team names                                   |
| `pnw #n X Y O L N` | New player connected                   |
| `ppo #n X Y O` | Player position                              |
| `plv #n L`     | Player level                                 |
| `pin #n X Y q0..q6` | Player inventory                       |
| `pex #n`       | Player expulsion                             |
| `pbc #n M`     | Broadcast message                            |
| `pic X Y L #n...` | Start of incantation                    |
| `pie X Y R`    | End of incantation (`R` = 0: fail, 1: success)|
| `pfk #n`       | Player lays egg                              |
| `enw #e #n X Y`| Egg laid by player                           |
| `ebo #e`       | Player hatched from egg                      |
| `edi #e`       | Egg died                                     |
| `pdr #n i`     | Player drops resource                        |
| `pgt #n i`     | Player takes resource                        |
| `pdi #n`       | Player dies                                  |
| `seg N`        | Game over - team `N` wins                    |
| `sgt T`        | Current time unit                            |
| `sst T`        | Time unit updated                            |
| `smg M`        | Server message                               |
| `suc`          | Unknown command                              |
| `sbp`          | Command syntax error                         |

The GUI must implement a stateful listener loop and render the game based on these updates.

## üß± Project Components

### üß† `server/` ‚Äî The Game Server

The `zappy_server` is the core of the game. It handles:

- player and team management
- resource generation and map state
- the execution of all AI commands
- event scheduling and game progression
- communication with both GUI and AI clients via TCP

It implements the full protocol, command queueing, and time-based execution system.
